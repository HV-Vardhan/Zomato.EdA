>## ` EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS `

## Introduction 
  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is a preliminary step of Machine Learning and is used extensively in this field. Although it is not necessary to perform EDA to build models, but it is definitely recommended as it helps to know the data better. If performed correctly, it gives us insights which are not easy to witness directly.



## Project Overview

The restaurant industry plays an important role in the development of the culinary field; It is more than food, it shows our culture and lifestyle. As more and more people move to cities and change their lifestyles, the demand for food is increasing. This study helps us understand detailed information about world using various tools. Understand all aspects of their food preferences, willingness/willingness to pay at a restaurant, and what services they expect from a restaurant. We use the Zomato dataset to understand the various factors we see. This helps in understanding the customers' behavior and the growth of the restaurant business. First we need to clean the data because this is not easy. We started with a large database of over 200,000 rows and 26 rows, but after cleaning we ended up with around 55,000 unique restaurants and 26 rows. This ensures that our analysis is accurate and reliable. Statistical Data Analysis (EDA) uses a variety of statistical and visual techniques to identify patterns and trends to better understand the Indian restaurant industry. The analysis showed the geographical distribution of food. We also provide insight to restaurants, investors and food enthusiasts alike by examining restaurant brands, food preferences and value investing. Combining quantitative analysis with insights, this study aims to understand the growth of the Indian restaurant industry and identify untapped opportunities in which food is more beneficial.


## __Libraries used__
* __Numpy__ is used for mathematical or numerical computation, it works on Numpy can work on multidimensional data, which makes it suitable for every dataset available.
* __Pandas__ - This library is built on top of NumPy and provides high-level data structures and tools for data analysis. The two primary data structures in Pandas are Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrames (two-dimensional), which are similar to spreadsheets and offer powerful ways to manipulate and analyze data.
* __Matplotlib__- This is a versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib offers a wide variety of plots like line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more. It excels because of customization and allows for in-depth control over the look and feel of your visualizations.
* __Seaborn__- This library is built on top of Matplotlib and specifically designed for creating statistical graphics. Seaborn offers a higher-level interface compared to Matplotlib, making it easier to create attractive, informative visualizations for data exploration. It integrates seamlessly with pandas DataFrames, making it a popular choice for data scientists.
